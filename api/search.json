This essay totally agrees with this statement because this will lead to a serious depletion of resources and pollution\nExamplesOpinionIn some countries an increasing number of people are suffering from health problems as a result ofeating too much fast food. It is therefore necessary for governments to impose a higher tax on this kind of food. \nDo you agree?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is argued that states should charge fast food companies more tax because of the growing amount of men and women with health conditions associated with this type of food. This essay totally agrees with that statement because these illnesses cost the health service too much money and increasing the price of junk food would reduce the demand for it.\nDiscussionSome people work for the same organisation all their working life.Others think that it is better to work for different organisations.\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome say that it is more beneficial to be employed with the same company all their lives, while others would argue that it is better to work for a variety of companies. This essay will argue that although working for just one employer gives you more financial and other benefits,working at lots of different places provides an employee with more experience.\nAdvantages and DisadvantagesOne of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing.\nDo you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the results of modern medicine is that men and women are able to live longer. This essay will argue that despite the strain this might cause on the pension system,the alleviation of suffering means that the advantages far outweigh the drawbacks.\nProblem and SolutionSmartphones are becoming a common sight in the primary school classroom.\nWhat problem does this cause and what is a viable solution?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPhones and other devices are being used more often by primary school children. This essay will suggest that they are very distracting and that the best solution is to ban them completely in class.\nDouble QuestionsCar ownership has increased so rapidly over the past thirty years that many cities in the world are now ‘one big traffic jam’.\nHow true do you think this statement is?\nWhat can governments do to discourage people from using their cars?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLots of city centers are highly congested due to an increase in the ownership of cars in the last three decades. This essay will argue that this is true only during peak times and that improving public transport will reduce this.\nBody paragraphsCommon Mistake\nToo many ideas\nUndeveloped ideas\nNo&#x2F;Poor explanations or examples\nFirstly, secondly, thirdly, finally\nPoor grammar and vocabulary\n\nChecklist\nRelevant ideas\nFully address all parts of the task\nClear position throughout\nFully extended and well supported ideas\n\nStructure - 3 Key Elements\nTopic Sentence\nExplanation Sentences\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is argued that states should charge fast food companies more tax because of the growing amount of men and women with health conditions associated with this type of food. This essay totally agrees with that statement because these illnesses cost the health service too much money and increasing the price of junk food would reduce the demand for it.\nObesity related illnesses cost the taxpayer billions of dollars every year. People who eat too much Food are more likely to suffer from costly diseases associated with being overweight. As a result, they have to go to hospital more regularly for treatment and this puts a strain on the health service. For example,a large proportion of the United Kingdom’s National Health Service budget is spent on preventable, obesity-related diseases, such as heart disease, hypertension and diabetes.\nTopic Sentence\nShort clear statement about what the paragraph is about\nDirectly answers the question\nNot much detail. \nMakes your main ideas clear\nCan’t write one unless you have clear ideas already\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction:\nincreasing the price of junk food would reduce the demand for it.\n↓\nTopic Sentence:\nAnother reason why fast food restaurants should pay extra tax is to raise the cost in order to decrease demand.\nExplanation\nPretend that you are writing to someone with on knowledge of the subject\n\nClear explain\n\nwhat you topic sentence means\n\nhow it answers the question\n\nwhat the result is\n\n\n\nShould be around 2-4 sentences\n\nUseful language\n\nThat is to say… &#x3D; In other words…\nThis is because… &#x3D; The reason is…\nAs a result… &#x3D; Therefore…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother reason why fast food restaurants should pay extra tax is to raise the cost in order to decrease demand. Any extra tax would be added to the normal price of the food, and as prices go up fewer people will be able to afford to buy fatty food. Therefore, this would reduce the amount of junk food people eat and the result would be a healthier nation.\nExamplesBetter Examples\nReal examples\nConverting personal examples\n\nHow to think of examples\nTake examples from your own life experience\n\nConvert them into more general examples\n\nThink about\n\nWhere are you form?\nWhere do you live\nWhat is  your job?\nWhat about your family and friends?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal:\nFor example, I used to smoke 20 cigarettes everyday, but the government kept increasing the tax and now I can’t afford to smoke.\n↓\nGeneral:\nFor example, when the duty on cigarettes is raised each year in the UK, more people quit smoking and this has a knock on effect on the number of people dying from lung cancer and other smoking related diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour own personal experience:\nMy sister’s bookshop closed down because it couldn’t compete with Amazon.\n↓\nGeneral:\nFor instance, many bookshops in the UK closed down because of competition from online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour own personal experience:\nI can’t afford to buy a laptop for my child.\n↓\nGeneral:\nFor example, in Ireland laptops are very expensive which would prevent most parents from being able to purchase them for their children.\nConclusionBig Mistakes\nNew ideas\n\nTrying to be entertaining\n\nBeing too vague\n\nRepeating exactly the same thing as in the rest of your essay\n\nUsing the wrong cohesive devices\n\n\nWhy are conclusions important?\nIt is the last thing the examiner reads\nIt shows the examiner that you can summarise\nOpinion is clear the whole way through\nMakes essay cohesive and coherent\n\nAppropriate Cohesive Devices\nIn conclusion, \nTo conclude,\n\nStructure\nTwo essential things are \n\nSummary of main points\nOpinion\n\n\nOne sentences\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nThe continued rise in the world’s population is the greatest threat faced by humanity at the present time. Do you agree?\nIntroduction:\nIncreasing overpopulation is the biggest threat human beings face today. This essay totally agrees with this statement because this will lead to a serious depletion of resources and pollution.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, there are too many people in the world and this is a huge threat to everyone becauseessential resources are running out and we are also polluting our planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction:\niPhones and other devices are being used more often by primary school children. This essay willsuggest that they are very distracting and that the best solution is to ban them completely in class.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, mobiles are not a good idea for young children because they interfere with the learning process and this should be stopped by telling parents that they are not allowed in schools.\nReview\nGrammar\n\nPrepositions\nArticles\nVerb-subject agreement\nCountable&#x2F;Uncountable nouns\nTenses\nCapital letters\n\n\nVocabulary\nFirst you should scan for any words repeated that you can easily change using synonyms.\nFocus on\n\nCollocations\nMeaning \nSpelling \nWord form\n\n\nChecklist\n\nDoes the essay answer all parts of the question?\nIs the opinion clear in the introduction?\nDoes each supporting paragraph have a clear topic sentence?\nAre ideas fully developed with explanations and examples?\nIs your opinion clear throughout the whole essay?\nIs there a suitable conclusion?\nOver 250 words?\nRange of complex and simple sentences.\nAnything confusing or unclear?\n\n\n\n1.
