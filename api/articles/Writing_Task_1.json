Moreover, it is noteworthy that the sales of educational books remained lower than those of others from 2002 to 2005.</p>\n<p>Upon closer examination of the data, it is discernible that the sales of children’s book began at approximately 32 million dollars, escalated to around 46 million dollars in 2005, and culminated at its highest point in 2006. Conversely, the sales of educational books remained relatively constant, with an average of roughly 28 million dollars.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the sales of adults’ fiction commenced at about 45 million dollars in 2002 and underwent a reduction of about 9 million dollars in 2003.

Specifically, the percentage change in zinc prices rose towards the end of the year, whereas nickel prices experienced a decline. Moreover, the stability in the percentage changes of copper prices is noteworthy compared to the other two metals.</p>\n<p>Upon closer examination of the data, it is clear that the price of nickel began with a significant increase of 6% in January, followed by a sharp decline to -3% in June. After maintaining a steady trajectory for three months, there was a rapid increase to 1% in November. Furthermore, the changes in zinc prices generally mirrored those of nickel, except in January when zinc showed a modest rise of 1%. Additionally, the price of copper exhibited minimal fluctuations, hovering between -0.5% and 2% throughout the year.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, while nickel and zinc prices showed considerable volatility in 2014, copper prices remained relatively stable, highlighting the distinct price behaviors of these metals.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The graph below gives information about the percentage of the population in four Asian countries living in cities from 1970 to 2020, with predictions for 2030 and 2040.

Moreover, the trends for the Philippines and Thailand follow a comparable pattern, while Indonesia and Malaysia exhibit similar increasing patterns.</p>\n<p>Upon closer examination, the urban populations of both Malaysia and the Philippines began at approximately 31 percent in 1970. However, while Malaysia’s urban population is predicted to surge to 81 percent by 2040, the Philippines is expected to see a more modest rise, reaching 53 percent.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Thailand’s urban population rate started at 18 percent, and Indonesia’s at 14 percent in 1970. However, by 2020, Indonesia had surpassed Thailand, and it is projected to continue growing rapidly to 60 percent by 2040, while Thailand’s is predicted to reach 48 percent.</p>\n</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"custom-details\">\n<summary>Bar Chart</summary>\n<p>The chart below shows the number of households in the US by their annual income in 2007, 2011 and 2015.

Additionally, the second-highest income group consistently had the fewest households throughout the period.</p>\n<p>Looking more closely at the data, the number of households in the lowest income group (less than $25,000) and the second-lowest income group ($25,000-$49,999) were quite similar, with both standing at around 26 million in 2007. By 2015, both groups saw a modest increase, reaching approximately 28 million. Meanwhile, households with an annual income between $50,000 and $74,999 remained relatively stable, hovering around 22 million over the same period.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the second-highest income group ($75,000-$99,999) experienced little fluctuation, remaining steady at approximately 14 million households between 2007 and 2015. Households earning $100,000 or more represented the largest group in 2015, increasing from 29 million in 2007 to 33 million by 2015.</p>\n\n</details>\n<h2 id=\"流程图\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#流程图\"></a> 流程图</h2>\n<h3 id=\"第一段介绍流程\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#第一段介绍流程\"></a> 第一段，介绍流程</h3>\n<p>The diagram demonstrates the sequence of events in the xxx process.</p>\n<p>The flowchart exhibits the various steps required to complete the xxx process.</p>\n<p>The diagram demonstrates the intricate details of xxx, providing a comprehensive overview of its integral components.</p>\n<h3 id=\"第二段宏观信息\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#第二段宏观信息\"></a> 第二段，宏观信息</h3>\n<p>Generally, it could be witnessed that totally 18 steps in relation to the whole process.</p>\n<p>What is more, xxx</p>\n<p>The process can be meticulously broken down into a total xxx distinct phrases, each of which plays a pivotal role in the overall sequence.</p>\n<h3 id=\"第三第四段具体流程\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#第三第四段具体流程\"></a> 第三第四段，具体流程</h3>\n<p>Upon closer examination towards the process, xxx.</p>\n<p>Moreover, xxx.</p>\n<details class=\"custom-details\">\n<summary>直线类</summary>\n<p><p>流程从A开始，到B结束</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Starting from A, the process moves through several steps and ends at B.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Commencing with the initiation of A, the progression then methodically transitions through a series of intricately interwoven stages, culminating in the finalization at B.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>在进入下一个步骤之前，xxx发生了</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Before advancing to the next phase, xxx occurs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A结束后，步骤就到了B</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Once A is finished, the process moves on to B</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"custom-details\">\n<summary>分支类</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In the mean time, xxx is happening alongside xxx.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once reaching the juncture at xxx, the process splits into two divergent pathways: one leading towards xxx and the other navigating towards xxx.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</details>\n<details class=\"custom-details\">\n<summary>循环类</summary>\n<p><p>A cyclic pattern is evident, with xxx recurrently looping back to xxx, thereby perpetuating a continuous cycle of operations.</p>\n</p>\n</details>\n<h2 id=\"位置图\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#位置图\"></a> 位置图</h2>\n<h3 id=\"第一段\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#第一段\"></a> 第一段</h3>\n<p>The map highlights the notable changes took place in xxx from 2002 to 2003.</p>\n<p>The maps illustrates the changes that have taken places in xxx over the years, specially between xxx and xxx.</p>\n<p>The provided map portrays the evolving landscape of xxx(地区) over the whole period.</p>\n<h3 id=\"第三第四段\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#第三第四段\"></a> 第三第四段</h3>\n<p>In the central region of A, a new xxx has been constructed.</p>\n<p>xxx被修建在A区域的中间</p>\n<p>During the period, the A area has experienced substantial growth and improvement, including the new-building xxx.</p>\n<p>A区域扩张了，包括一个新建的xxx</p>\n<details class=\"custom-details\">\n<summary>某物在某位置</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>Nestled in the xxx quadrant of the depicted scheme, a prominent xxx emerges.</li>\n<li>In the xxx part of the diagram, you can see a noticeable xxx.</li>\n<li>Commanding a central position within the illustration, the xxx is conspicuously situated.</li>\n<li>Perched at the edge of the delineated region, the xxx marks its presence.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</details>\n<details class=\"custom-details\">\n<summary>旁边有什么</summary>\n<p><p>Abutting the A, B asserts itself.</p>\n</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"custom-details\">\n<summary>面积增大</summary>\n<p>A palpable enlargement in the domain of the xxx is observed, suggesting spatial expansion.</p>\n<p>There is a noticeable increase in the size of the xxx, indicating it has expanded</p>\n\n</details>\n<details class=\"custom-details\">\n<summary>某设施更换</summary>\n<p><p>Where the xxx once stood in xxx, now the xxx makes its mark</p>\n</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"custom-details\">\n<summary>某设施数量增加</summary>\n<p>xxx now boasts an increased array of xxx</p>\n\n</details>\n<details class=\"custom-details\">\n<summary>Articles</summary>\n<p><p>The maps below show an industrial area in the town of Norbiton, and planned future development of the site.</p>\n<p>Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.</p>\n<img src=\"https://eumcm.com/file/AgACAgUAAyEGAASP1xWzAAMEZt3KsegziUsm2U4dNGbTnJ49SEYAAoy9MRuea_FWsyj1z22sEhsBAAMCAAN5AAM2BA.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" />\n<img src=\"https://eumcm.com/file/AgACAgUAAyEGAASP1xWzAAMFZt3K6V4zxdMJ1uqUTEbggIoCpGMAApC9MRuea_FWdiaOmTWuhpUBAAMCAAN5AAM2BA.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" />\n<p>The maps illustrate the current layout of the Norbiton industrial area and the proposed future development of the region.</p>\n<p>In general, it is evident that more residential areas and facilities will replace the current factories.
